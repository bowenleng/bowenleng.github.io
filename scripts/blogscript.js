// basic idea, read every single json file in the blogs folder and then sort them by date
// after sorting by date, use a for loop to add new elements with the ids of "#sec" + (number in the array)
// List of possible allowed sorting criteria: sort by relevancy, sort by recency, and sort by authors
// maybe allow a search bar of some kind as well. A general search, search by title & subject, and search by author.
